My name is Ahammad Shawki. I am currently studying in Rajuk Uttara Model College. I am a 15 years old self taught Python Programmer, Data Scientist and Web Developer.

I grew up in Dhaka, Bangladesh. I am intersted in participating different Olympiads. I like Math, Problem Solving, Programming and Painting.

Professionally, I am very passionate about applications of Deep Learning, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. Python is my favourite programming language. Currently, I am working in a project about "DSA Implementations in Python". This project focuses implementing different data structures and algorithms in Python language.

Iâ€™m interested in internship opportunities in Data science, Software Engineering and all other Python developer opportunities. I am available for the next internship cycle (2021 summer). Send me an email if you think I am a good match for your company.
